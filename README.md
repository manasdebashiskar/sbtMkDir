# sbtMkDir
This project creates directory structure for initial sbt projects that is usually created manually.

Many a times I have to start an sbt project where multiple level directory path creation is required. It is not difficult but boring and can be easily automated.

##Final version
My final plan is to create a sbt plugin that can be installed in the ~/.sbt/0.13/plugins/plugins.sbt(for the current sbt versions)
Usage will be sbt initializeProjectDirs
